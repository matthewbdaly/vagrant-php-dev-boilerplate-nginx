Vagrant PHP Dev Boilerplate Nginx
=================================

A boilerplate Vagrant configuration for PHP development, using Nginx instead of Apache.

In addition, if you want to use MongoDB as your database instead of MySQL, there's an alternative bootstrap script at `mongobootstrap.sh` that sets up MongoDB instead of MySQL. To use it, replace the reference to `bootstrap.sh` in `Vagrantfile` with `mongobootstrap.sh`
